title: Limit Breaking 101

## Information

* This list was originally compiled by Dev in the Lancers Reactor topic Limit Breaking 101. Credit for finding the original offsets and otherwise starting this list go to Dev.
* All offsets are for files from the official 1.1 patch.
* Numbers are in hexadecimal, or suffixed to indicate their type:

| Suffix | Type    | Size                 |
| ------ | ------- | -------------------- |
| f      | float   | 4 bytes              |
| d      | double  | 8 bytes              |
| i      | integer | 4 bytes              |
| b      | byte    | 1 byte (-128 to 127) |

A value like "0F 85 -> 90 E9" means replace the original bytes on the left with the new bytes on the right. (The bytes are given in file order, they don't represent a number like the offset.)
