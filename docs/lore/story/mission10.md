### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Kusari-biased perspective.

#### TEKAGI MURDERED!
> The Kusari people are in mourning today for one of the few great men of our time: Governor Yoshinobu Tekagi. Upon hearing of his murder by armed assassins, Shogun Edo was enraged and shouted for vengeance. An Imperial task force has been called in to investigate what is left of the Governor’s retreat.

#### Tekagi Investigation
> As investigators speculate on the identity of the killers who took the life of the greatly beloved Governor Tekagi, they say that there is no concrete evidence to support The Order in the list of suspects. Despite suggestions that operatives from the Blood Dragons or even a Rheinland strike force may have played a role, Shogun Edo insists that The Order must be to blame.

#### Bonnerille Alive and Well
> Director Aemon Bonnerille of the Liberty Security Force, who was previously thought to be missing, resurfaced today. In a press conference, he said that rumors of his disappearance were simply that — rumors. He blamed the irresponsible media for the controversy and confirmed that he had been sequestered in a secure location following a possible threat to his personal security.

#### Dissension in Liberty?
> Unconfirmed reports state that several high-ranking admirals and government officials have started to criticize President Jacobi’s recent actions. There is even a rumor of some calling for her impeachment.

### Rumours

## Mission Accepted

Once this mission was accepted, the following news and rumours are available to read.

### News
Those news are displaying a possibly Rheinland-biased perspective.

#### Kusari Prepares for Invasion!
> Before being destroyed, probes from the Ministry of Strategic Information revealed that the Kusari government has been assembling a massive attack force behind the Honshu Jump Gate, a clear precursor to invasion. The Chancellor himself urged his people to remain united, and he pledged to seek out our enemies wherever they may be hiding. So let us support the Chancellor to assure a peaceful and united Rheinland.

#### A Word of Truth
> The Ministry of Truth wishes to remind Rheinland citizens that all of the news and information coming through the official channels is personally viewed by our Chancellor. If he watches, shouldn’t you?

#### Jacobi a Traitor?
> Sources inside the Chancellor’s office indicate that the power-hungry President of Liberty has severed all diplomatic ties with Rheinland — obviously in preparation for war. However, political unrest troubles her own government, as several high-ranking officers have publicly expressed their feelings that the President is working against the best interests of her people. Some allege that she could be guilty of corruption, possibly even treason.

#### Liberty Suppresses Media!
> Elsewhere in the colonies, news of the Liberty President’s political troubles has been utterly suppressed by the “iron fist of the Liberty media machine.” We are grateful to the Chancellor and the Ministry of Truth for their tireless commitment to the freedom of information that we enjoy here in Rheinland.

#### Heroic Chancellor Stands Firm
> In the latest threat from Liberty, President Jacobi has issued an ultimatum to our beloved Chancellor stating that we will be invaded unless we immediately disarm. The Chancellor defiantly declared that he will never let Kusari sap our vitality nor capitulate to Liberty’s bullying and self-serving tactics.

#### Bretonia Still an Ally
> As Liberty continues to support the Kusari-backed criminals, guilty of terrorist activities against the sovereign state of Rheinland, and as Jacobi amasses her own invasion force, Bretonia appears to have come to her senses. The Chancellor, a long-time ally, is reportedly now reaching out to Queen Carina for her support in standing against Liberty’s empty threats.

#### Jacobi Found Guilty
> The chief conspirator herself, President Barbara Jacobi, appears to be losing control, as pressure is being applied by the Liberty Navy and other leaders who want to remove her from office. Recent information shows that she may be guilty of treason and conspiracy with The Order. Perhaps it is time for the military to take control and initiate formal charges in the name of peace.

#### TO VICTORY!
> With our destiny before us, we march on. The Chancellor has struck the first blow for the Rheinland state by crossing into Honshu and engaging the Kusari enemy. With our loyal support, our Chancellor will guide us to victory.

#### WAR!!!
> IT’S WAR! Rheinland ships penetrated the Honshu defensive perimeter and are now in Kusari space. Our military forces have rallied, led by the Shogun and his Generals, and are successfully defending our cities. Soldiers, police, civilians, and even the unlawful have gathered together to fight the Rheinland invaders.

#### Rheinland Crushes Criminals
> Today Rheinland peacekeepers met resistance from a weak and poorly organized criminal group. They were immediately neutralized and disarmed, and the survivors were captured for re-education and rehabilitation. Praise to the Chancellor for his mercy!
