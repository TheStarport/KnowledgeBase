## Downloading Freelancer (if you don't have a CD-Rom)

1. Download the 7zip archive from https://mega.nz/file/wo8lUSgR#xnHh0ISjS5rIopv3xgY9dMDcWt2SqePfg2CMkmBqz7s
2. Extract the archive
3. Run Setup.exe and follow the installation wizard.

Windows can sometimes flag this as a false positive. To verify the integrity of the download, here are the hashes:

```

## Freelancer: HD Edition (1.1, JFLP, No-CD, HD textures and more) - Option 1

1. Download the latest FreelancerHDSetup.exe from https://www.moddb.com/mods/freelancer-hd-edition/downloads
2. Open the setup file and read the instructions on-screen carefully 

**Note:** This includes all the files contained in Option 2 (below). Use the 2nd option if you don't want HD Textures + Enchancements.

## Vanilla Patch (Combined 1.1, JFLP, No-CD) - Option 2

1. Download the self extracting zip: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/661329208609603617/752174852722393169/FLCombinedPatch.exe
2. Extract to your Freelancer installation e.g. **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Freelancer** 

:::caution

You will need to right click and "Run as Admin" for the patch if installing to Program Files. We never reccomend installing the game to the default location in Program files unless you have a very specific reason to.
